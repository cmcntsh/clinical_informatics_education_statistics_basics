* Creating tables in Excel
    * Don't have anything above the first row of your table
    * Start in cell A1
    * Each column should have a header (variable name)
    * Column names should be unique
    * Avoid spaces in column names
      * It's OK for Excel, but it's better not to have spaces if you may export your data for use in other analysis software.
    * Remove any summary rows. Only have data rows.
    * Don't merge cells. (Unmerge them if any exist.)
    * Don't use formatting to code for meaning. (i.e. text color, highlighting) If you need to add some meaning to a row, create a new column to code that meaning with text/numbers.
* Tidy data
